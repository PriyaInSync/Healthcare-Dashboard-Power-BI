# Healthcare-Dashboard-Power-BI
This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI for analyzing healthcare data from a hospital's patient records. The dataset includes information such as patient demographics, admission and discharge dates, diagnoses, treatments, doctors involved, feedback scores, billing amounts, and health insurance claims. Visual representation of patient demographics and admission trends over time. Features: Breakdown of diagnoses and treatment types (e.g., MRI, CT Scan, Blood Test) by department. Comparative analysis of billing amounts versus health insurance reimbursements. Feedback analysis to understand patient satisfaction levels and areas for improvement. Interactive filters for detailed exploration of data subsets.

Outcome: The Power BI dashboard provides hospital administrators, healthcare providers, and stakeholders with a clear, actionable view of operational performance and patient outcomes. It aims to facilitate data-driven decisions that enhance efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall patient care and satisfaction.

Future Scope: Future enhancements may include integrating real-time data feeds, predictive analytics for patient outcomes, and further customization based on specific departmental needs or regulatory requirements.

Conclusion: By leveraging Power BI's capabilities for data visualization and analysis, this project aims to transform raw healthcare data into meaningful insights that drive continuous improvement in healthcare delivery and patient experience.
